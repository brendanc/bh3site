<h4>What is a hash?</h4>
<p>
	A "hash" is in short a 'run'.  A 'hare' sets a trail using chalk or flour or some other stuff.  Everyone meets at a predetermined place, known as the 'prelube' and get some rudimentary instructions about the days trail.  
</p>
<p>A 'hash' involves a trail that is set by some unlucky group of hashers, typically a lead and some helpers. These poor sods are known as the 'hares'. This also leads to the use of the terms 'harriers' (male) and 'harriettes' (female) when referencing hashers in general. The trails themselves are anywhere between three and six miles long. Trail is typically marked in flour or chalk.</p>
