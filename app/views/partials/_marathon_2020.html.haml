%p The Boston Hash House Harriers present 

%h1 Boston H3's - The Flying 'Marathon' Circus

%p April 17 - 20, 2020

%p Strange women lying in ponds distributing beer, is no basis for a major event! Do we care? NO! After all there's nothing wrong with you that an extensive trail can't prolong. Join us for our Marathon main event, where we'll we seek the holy grails (of beer), quest for shrubberies (and shots), and be known as the r*unners who say "ON-ON" all throughout Boston.

%p And now for something completely different.
