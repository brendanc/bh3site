%p The Boston Hash House Harriers present 

%h1 Game of Boners: A Song of Fireball and Smirnoff Ice

%p April 13 - 15, 2019

%p In the Game of Boners, you either rage or you dragon. Hashers seek the mythical tale of good beer and shots, while the ancient enemies Smirnoff Ice and Fireball return after being dormant for thousands of seconds. A hasher always finishes their drink, so join us in waving a giant middle finger to the god of sobriety! For the night is long and full of UGHs...
