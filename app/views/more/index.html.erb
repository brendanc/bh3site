    <h4>Join the NEW EMAIL LIST!</h4>
	<h3>The Runs List</h3>
	<p>Since Yahoo is killing off its groups and email lists, BH3 is moving to a Google group and email list. This is a low volume site for announcing runs (or parties, etc, if you want to invite the hash), posting write-ups of past runs, asking for rides to runs, and looking for lost items after the run. In other words important stuff. Try to avoid ongoing discussions or "me too" responses. To post a message, you must be subscribed to the group. </p>
