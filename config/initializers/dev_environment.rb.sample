# To use Google Calender and Map APIs we need API Keys
# We shouldn't keep those in source control because they're secret, shhhh
# When working locally, rename this to dev_environment.rb and put your keys below to make everything work for you

unless Rails.env.production?
    puts 'NOT PROD'   
    ENV['GOOGLE_CLIENT_API_KEY'] = 'PUT YOUR KEY HERE'
    ENV['GOOGLE_SERVER_API_KEY'] = 'PUT YOUR KEY HERE'
